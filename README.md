# Visual Basic Stock Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the VBA Stock Analysis challenge was to refactor the VBA code that I worked on in the module lessons. The original VBA code contained nested loops, which worked well for a small amount of data, but could run into efficiency issues with a larger dataset. In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a summary of 12 stocks containing ~3k lines of data that would run through VBA and provide a summary of each of the stocks perfomance for 2017 and 2018 depending on what the user selects.
